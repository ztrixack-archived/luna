/**
 * API for sending log output.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Generally, use the Log.v() Log.d() Log.i() Log.w() and Log.e() methods.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The order in terms of verbosity, from least to most is ERROR, WARN, INFO,
 * DEBUG, VERBOSE. Verbose should never be compiled into an application except
 * during development. Debug logs are compiled in but stripped at runtime.
 * Error, warning and info logs are always kept.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Tip:</b> A good convention is to declare a <code>TAG</code> constant in
 * your class:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * private static final String TAG = &quot;MyActivity&quot;;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and use that in subsequent calls to the log methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Tip:</b> Don't forget that when you make a call like
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Log.v(TAG, &quot;index=&quot; + i);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * that when you're building the string to pass into Log.d, the compiler uses a
 * StringBuilder and at least three allocations occur: the StringBuilder itself,
 * the buffer, and the String object. Realistically, there is also another
 * buffer allocation and copy, and even more pressure on the gc. That means that
 * if your log message is filtered out, you might be doing significant work and
 * incurring significant overhead.
